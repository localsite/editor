# Google Sheet Editor

We're working toward a process to edit rows in a [MapsForUs Google Sheet](../localsite/map/mapsforus) using REST/CRUD after logging into a Google account within a brower.   

Javascript browser-frontend work resides in [Google-OneTap](onetap/).   

This repo requires having the [localsite repo](https://github.com/localsite/) in an adjacent folder in the same site root. See [getting started](../localsite/start/).  

Go to [console.developers.google.com](https://console.developers.google.com/). Under "Domain Verification" enter domains (works on localhost before doing this). Verify ownership by copying html file into site root. (Used maps.g account) <!-- also added l email.) -->

It may be possible to duplicate some of the following server-side process using this Python 2.7

using Google Cloud Function Web Service that appends any data sent to it to a Google sheet using a NodeJS script. Also sends an email notification.

<h1>Flask Version (Incomplete)</h1>

Using Flask may not be necessary is using the [Google Cloud Function NodeJS example](https://medium.com/@abuango/how-to-collect-form-data-from-a-jamstack-website-to-google-sheets-using-google-cloud-functions-a59546c803a5) (Also linked above.)

These <a href='https://realpython.com/flask-google-login/'>Flask Google Login</a> set-up steps may be similar.

Here are steps for deploying [Flask to Google Cloud with Docker into a Kubernetes Cluster](https://medium.com/honeybadger-ai/how-to-deploy-machine-learning-models-using-flask-docker-and-google-cloud-platform-gcp-6e7bf1b339d5)  
<br>


## A. Clone this Repo

You'll be adding private keys, then running a local Python Flask server.  
Clone from <a href="https://github.com/modelearth/editor">github.com/modelearth/editor</a>  

## B. Get your Auth IDs

[Create a Google Project or use existing project IDs](google)  

## C. Install the Editor

1. Open a terminal in the local "editor" folder.

1. Install Python 3.7 if you don't have it currently.  

```
	python3 -V
```

3. Within your editor root directory run commands:
```
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

4. Run/Server python app.

```
cd app
python3 app.py
```
5. Go to [https://127.0.0.1:5000/](https://127.0.0.1:5000/) to view the app.  
<!-- Doesn't show same: or [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) -->


In Safari you will see "Your connection is not private".  
Click the "Advanced" button to view insecurely locally.  

If successful, you will see a 'Google Login' and you'll be able to login to your Google account to see "Hi [firstname]! Logout"  
This does not work in Chrome or Brave (tested on a Mac).   


## D. Self-Signed SSL

Even after installing locally, you will see a browser warning indicating that the certificate should not be trusted. You can proceed past this warning to view the encrypted site. 

Generate a self-signed ssl with openssl - <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">We need to document this procedure or link to an external page with steps.</span>  

Skip this step for now and use the "Advanced" button to view locally.  
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">("Advanced" button only works on Safari. Not working on Chrome or Brave on Mac.)</span>  

Viewing at: <a href="https://127.0.0.1:5000">https://127.0.0.1:5000</a>   

The following did not work yet. (This was not needed for Safari.):  

<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-certificate-self">Generate Self-Signed SSL Certificate</a><br>

After generating, tried adding to the "System" keychain, but error continues: NET::ERR\_CERT\_INVALID

<!--
## D. For MapsForUs Auth

To do: [Config to avoid Unverified apps error](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/7454865) - To include email in [MapsForUs comment](../localsite/) in our copy of the MapsforUS Google Sheet Template.


Also did for gsample

Added model.earth as authorized domain on "OAuth consent screen"
(Only allows top level domain, like model.earth)

And here too (verify via HTML):

 [&#x2714;] Show/Hide edit menu on Login/Logout.  
 [ &nbsp; ] Edit form.  
-->

<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
<b>TO DO:</b> Create a CRUD/REST form based on [Real World](https://neighborhood.org/realworld) and set-up a [Real World Starter Kit](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-starter-kit) that also works with [Google Cloud Functions](https://medium.com/@abuango/how-to-collect-form-data-from-a-jamstack-website-to-google-sheets-using-google-cloud-functions-a59546c803a5)  

<b>Proposed Frontend:</b> Either existing "Vanilla JS Web Components" ([initial tests](https://model.earth/localsite/resources/google-onetap/)) or use JQuery. 

<b>Proposed Backend for Trust Levels:</b> Either a Google API Flask connector, DJango with Discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse), or another Trust Level storehouse, like Google Firebase.
